This is a Game Of Life Implementation in Java.  To run the program:

- Run the GameOfLifeMain class in your favorite Java IDE.  By default, grid size is 25x25 and the Game Of Life simulation is arranged in the 10 cell row.
- To run Game Of Life with random cells, edit TheGrid class.  In specific, enable the "Random grid    logic" located in the nested for loop.  Make sure to comment out the fixed grid logic.

- TDD tests are located in GameOfLifeTest.java
